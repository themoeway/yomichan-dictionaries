# TheMoeWay Yomichan Dictionaries Pack Issues   

 Pack can be found at [https://learnjapanese.moe](https://learnjapanese.moe/)  
  
If you didn't know already, we have been working on new dictionaries for the browser extension Yomichan. Mainly monolingual (J-J) dictionaries as the ones zero-epwing support are not sufficient enough to use a monolingual dictionary 100% of the time when reading Japanese content such as novels, the news and Wikipedia.    
We have come up with a solution: make more dictionaries using newer sources.  

### We have made the following so far:  
- **三省堂 大辞林 第三版** (Sanseido Daijirin 3rd Edition)   
- **小学館 デジタル大辞泉** (Shogakukan Digital Daijisen)  
- **三省堂 新明解国語辞典 第七版** (Sanseido Shinmeikai Kokugojiten 7th Edition)  
- **岩波書店 岩波国語辞典 第六版** (Iwanami-shoten Iwanami Kokugojiten 6th Edition)  
- **三省堂 ハイブリッド新辞林** (Sanseido Hybrid Shinjirin)  
- **実用日本語表現辞典** (Jitsuyou Nihongo Hyougen Jiten)  
- **小学館 国語大辞典** (Shogakukan Kokugodaijiten)  
- **小学館 精選版 日本国語大辞典** (Shogakukan Seisenban Nihonkokugodaijiten)  
- **漢字源** (Kanjigen)  
- **Weblio 古語辞典** (Weblio Dictionary of Archaisms)  
- **CEDICT** (Chinese-English Dictionary)  
- **大修館書店 中日大辞典 第二版** (Taishukan-shoten Chinese-Japanese Dictionary, Second Edition) 

Anything else not listed, although present in the pack, was not made by TheMoeWay and we kindly ask you to **not** open an issue regarding unlisted dictionaries.  
  
## How to open an issue  
In the issues tab, create a new issue with the green button.   

For title, make sure you put the dictionary name first, and append a brief summary of the issue. Example: "大辞林 第三版: Reading information not found for *word*"   

Then in the body, make sure you provide the **full** name of the dictionary in question. Do NOT say "daijriin" or "shinmeikai", make sure you state the FULL name, "Daijirin 3rd edition" or "大辞林第三版".   

Then you must provide a screenshot of the Yomichan pop up window and/or search page.  

## Examples of Issues  
Examples of issues can be found below.  

### Entry is present but does not appear in search  
詔す is present in 精選版 日本国語大辞典 but does not appear when searched, although it is under the entry for 詔.  

### No reading information for expressions  
In 大辞林 第三版, 肩が凝る does not have reading information and does not appear when you do a kana search for かたがこる  

### Kanji repetition mark (々) not detected (problem across all dictionaries)  
Looking up 赤裸々 will not work unless you search 赤裸裸 or せきらら。  

<h1> DO NOT REPORT MISSING WORDS!</h1>  

You should only report missing words when it is present when you do a kana search or if it is in the source it was converted from. See below for all dictionaries and their sources.
